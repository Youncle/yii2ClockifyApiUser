SUMMARY

The yii2ClockifyApiUser uses the yii2 framework, more specifically, the basic one. The logic behind the main focus of the app
can be found in app/components/ClockifyClient.php . Initially, I created this app for the console only but then I thought it would be more user friendly to create an UI and I used yii2 framework to do it.
